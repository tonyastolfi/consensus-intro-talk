# Distributed Consensus: an introduction

This repo contains materials for a presentation I created to introduce
a generally technical audience to the topic of fail-stop
(non-Byzantine) distributed consensus algorithms.

The slides can be accessed directly from [here](

).

There are three interactive visualizations/animations included:

 - [State Machine Log Replication](https://storage.cloud.google.com/consensus-intro-talk/state-machines.html)
 - [Happy Path Update Workflow](https://storage.cloud.google.com/consensus-intro-talk/cluster.html)
 - [Leader Recovery Workflow](https://storage.cloud.google.com/consensus-intro-talk/recovery-simple.html)
