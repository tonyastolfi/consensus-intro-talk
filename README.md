# Distributed Consensus: an introduction

This repo contains materials for a presentation I created to introduce
a generally technical audience to the topic of fail-stop
(non-Byzantine) distributed consensus algorithms.

The slides can be accessed directly from [here](

There are three interactive visualizations/animations included:
